### 1) The Basics - Variables, Comments, and Running the dang thing!
To check version of python on cli  `python3 --version`
To run a program or python file `python3 <filename>`

Variable - a variable is a container for a value, which can be of various types.

VARIABLE RULES:
  - Variable names are case sensitive (name and NAME are not the same)
  - Must start with a letter or an underscore
  - Can have numbers but cannot start with one

```python
types of comments ...
 # starts a single line

 '''
 starts a multiline comment or a docstring (used to define a functions purpose)
 '''

```

### 2) The Basics - Strings!
Strings are surrounded by either single or double quotes.
Concatenate - insert a variable into a string `print('Hello, my name is ' + name)`
